A tuple is a single unit of data made up of multiple values. In Python they are defined using round brackets, with commas separating the values. Tuples can contain all sorts of data as values, but when programming Gemma we mostly use them for [colors]({{< relref "/glossary/color" >}}) `(red, green, blue, white)`.
