title: Structuring your files
---

When you plug your Gemma in to your computer, it will appear as a USB drive (probably D:, unless you've got something else already plugged in).
If you open the Gemma, you'll see a file called `code.py` or `main.py`. This is the file that your Gemma will run.
To change the program your Gemma is running, just edit this file!

```
D:/
├── code.py # on newer versions
├── main.py # on older versions
│
└── lib/
    └── ... # library files, which tell the software how to control hardware we might connect
```
