To program you Gemma M0 or other CircuitPython compatible hardware, you will need to either:
1. use Mu, or
2. use another editor
   
Mu is set up to be very helpful for beginners. It has some keyboard shortcuts, good help text, nice shortcut buttons, and is generally very friendly to use and has a lot of features to help beginners get started. It also includes a Serial Monitor, meaning Mu will automatically display information
sent back from your Gemma.

After you have been writing code for a while, you may find that a more powerful text editor like Visual Studio Code allows you a lot more power and flexibility, at the cost of complexity, and possibly doing some more basic things yourself.

## Using Mu

Install *Mu*, using the Company Portal (on a school computer), or from [the website](https://codewith.mu/).

To program your Gemma M0, make sure you select the mode *CircuitPython* (depending on your version, it may be called something slightly different,
but it is the mode with 'CircuitPython' somewhere in the title).

## Using Visual Studio Code

Install *Visual Studio Code* from the Company Portal (on a school computer), or from [the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
