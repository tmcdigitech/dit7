title: Structuring your files
---

Each of your projects should live in its own folder somewhere sensible (like in a Digital Tech folder in your OneDrive!).

```
project/
├── game.py
│
├── images/
│   ├── someImage.jpg
│   ├── anotherImage.jpg
│   └── ... # sprites, tiles and other image files
│
├── fonts/
│   └── ... # any font files
│
├── sounds/
│   └── ... # any sound files
│
└── music/
    └── ... # any music files
```

You don't need to include those folders unless you have something to put in them.

Note that the shortcut buttons in Mu will open folders in the *default* location. If you have saved your project in a different location (like your OneDrive) don't use these shortcut buttons, as they won't open the right folders.
