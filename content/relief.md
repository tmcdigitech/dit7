*Monday T2.9 (4 July)*

Hi all. Today is a chance for you to show off your teamwork skills. Work your way through the Activities in Task 1 on your Microbit. If you get stuck, or things are not working, see if the people around you can help. The most likely problem you'll make is spelling a word wrong, getting your capitals and lowercase letters mixed up, or using the wrong piece of punctuation.

If you get really stuck, you can email me.
